# Speech Emotion Recognition System

## Description

This repo includes Jupyter notebooks for Audio Signal Analysis and Feature Extraction (using Librosa) on CREMA-D dataset containing audio files for different emotion categories, followed by training of deep learning models on the extracted features using Keras and presenting the trained model via a dashboard (using Streamlit), as an interface to record real-time speech and provide a prediction of the emotion of the user.

## Usage

Run the dashboard using:
`streamlit run 4\ -\ Dashboard.py`
